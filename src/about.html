        <h4>
          I’m Nina Le (She/Her), a third-year design student at York University and a UX/UI designer pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Design. 
          I’m passionate about creating thoughtful, inclusive solutions that optimize feasibility, viability, and desirability for current or future features. 
          Whether working on UX/UI or experimental projects, I love diving into research and collaborating with cross-functional teams to craft experiences that truly cater to the user.
          <br><br>
          My attention to detail—shaped by years in choir and traditional/digital illustration—fuels my approach to design. 
          Combined with my industry experience, this foundation drives my focus on accessibility, precision, and creating work that feels both engaging and impactful.
